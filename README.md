# MÃ©gra Visualizer

A simple, browser-based score visualizer for live scoring over OSC.

You need `node.js` and `npm` installed on your system to run this.

To build, run `npm install && cd web && npm install`.

Now, in the root folder, you can start the app using `node scoreviz.js` and see the result in the
browser (`localhost:8081`).
